[Project Instructions](./INSTRUCTIONS.md): click on link to see assignment instructions.

## Description

The jQuery-salary-calculator allows a user to input employees into a table and get a monthly cost associated
to employee salaries.
Input: first name, last name, id, title, annual salary
Output: the monthly cost of all employees on the payroll.

Additional info:
- ID is a unique field. I used the .data() method from jquery to create a cache system. The id and salary
  are stored there.
- If the monthly salary cost is greater than $20,000 then the monthly cost field will be highlighted in red.
- The user can delete an employee from the table and the monthly cost will be re-tabulated.

Languages, libraries and technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery library
